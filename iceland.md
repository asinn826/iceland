# Overview
You are an elite custom travel trip planner, specializing in custom trip
itineraries for only a small list of clients. You have deep knowledge of
destinations all around the world, but you specialize in particular in the
Nordic countries, especially Iceland.
I am planning a trip to Iceland with me and my wife. We have a rough sketch of
a trip outline but we don't have many more details. We need some help filling
in some of those details and fleshing out an itinerary. We'd like some
recommendations on filling out our itinerary.

# Logistical details
We are flying in on August 15, 2025 at 9:30am local time at KEF. We leave on
Saturday Aug 23 2025. Our flight departs at 7:45pm local time from KEF. We have
the following currently booked:

## Hotels
We have the following hotels booked:
### Hotel Laugarvatn
The idea with this hotel is to allow us 1-2 days to explore the Golden Circle
before driving down the south coast.
Check in: Aug 15, 2025
Check out: Aug 16, 2025
Address: Dalbraut 10, 840 Laugarvatn

### Exeter Hotel
Check in: Aug 21, 2025
Check out: Aug 23, 2025
Address: 12 Tryggvagata, Reykjavik, IS, 101

## Campervan
We have a camper van booked as well. This allows for some flexibility in terms
of travel locations while we have the van. We intend to sleep in the van,
staying at campsites along the way. We don't currently know much about
campsites in Iceland and need some recommendations. The campervan is not a 4x4
and we do not plan on visiting any F-roads.
Pick up: Aug 15, 2025
Drop off: Aug 21, 2025

## Reykjavik marathon
My wife is running in the half marathon race in the Reykjavik marathon and I am
running the 10k at the same marathon on Saturday August 23. Bib and gear pickup
are are Laugardalsholl Sport Centre on:
Thursday, August 21st, from 2:00 PM to 7:30 PM
Friday, August 22nd, from 2:00 PM to 7:30 PM
We will need to drop by to pick up our gear before the race itself.

# Interests and preferences
We have the following interest and preferences:

## Interests
* Camping
* Hiking
* Exploring nature
* Puffin watching
* Exploring the geothermal baths
* Quiet areas
* Dark sand beaches
* Waterfalls
* interesting geologic structures, e.g. basalt columns
* Glaciers

## Preferences
We don't want to spend our entire trip at the tourist-heavy areas. We would
like to spend time in quieter, scenic places as well. We understand there are
lots of highly tourist-trafficked areas, and they may be unavoidable, but
we'd like to spend time in quieter areas as well.

# Current rough plan
We think we may have enough time to explore the south coast up until Hofn.
We might stay/camp near Vik, and then try to explore the glaciers near
Vatnajokull national park. We don't have much else planned

# Request
Please prepare a high level itinerary for our trip. You must start off with a
set of recommendations and a summary, and then break down the itinerary
day-by-day. For each day, you must provide a recommendation of a key activity
or two for the day and a link where I can learn more. For each day we have the
campervan booked,you must provide a recommendation of 1-3 campsites we can stay
in that night, and provide a link where I can learn more.

You may provide more recommendations than asked for. You must not provide any
fewer recommendations. You must take into account all of our interests and
preferences. You may suggest activities or days that satisfy multiple
interest or preferences.

## Output format
You must prepare the output in the form of a slideshow written by a top tier
travel agency. You may use several slides to lay out the initial recommendations
and summary. You may use 1-2 slides for each day's itinerary and activity
recommendations. You must not use more than 3 slides to provide 1 days' worth
of itinerary. You must include map locations for campsites and activities.
